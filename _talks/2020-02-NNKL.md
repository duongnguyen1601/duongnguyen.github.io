In this work, we study physics-informed deep learning models to identify the general time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations governing noisy data. We compare the performance of different regression techniques (LASSO, Ridge, TrainSTridge, and elastic net). We propose a different approach by employing pre-train neural networks to reduce the computation time.
