title: "Market-based Mechanisms For Fair And Efficient Re- source Allocation In Edge Computing"
collection: talks
type: "Talk"
excerpt: 'Edge computing enables novel Internet of Things applications and drastically enhances user experience. We propose a novel market equilibrium-based framework for allocating geographically distributed heterogeneous edge resources to competing services with diverse preferences in a fair and efficient manner. The proposed solution not only maximizes resource utilization but also gives each service its favorite resource bundle. Furthermore, the equilibrium allocation is Pareto-optimal and satisfies desired fairness properties including sharing incentive, proportionality, and envy-freeness. We also introduce privacy-preserving distributed algorithms for equilibrium computation.'
