title: "Two-stage Robust Edge Service Placement And Sizing Under Uncertainties"
collection: talks
type: "Talk"
excerpt: 'We study the optimal service placement and workload allocation problem under uncertainties from the perspective of a service provider who can procure resources from numerous distributed edge nodes. To tackle this problem, we propose novel two-stage and multi-period robust optimization models which aim to balance between minimizing the operating cost for the provider and improving the experience for its users, considering various uncertainties such as resource demand and edge node failures. We employ and tailor the column-and-constraint generation method to develop iterative algorithms to solve the proposed robust models, which show significant advantages compared to benchmark solutions.'
