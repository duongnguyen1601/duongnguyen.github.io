I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University working under the supervision of [Prof. Duong Tung Nguyen] (https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/duonglabasu/home). My current research interests include operations research, distributed optimization and game theory. The research focuses on developing mathematical models for decision-making under uncertainty, distributed algorithms, fair and privacy-preserving mechanism designs and economic analysis of large-scale network in multi-agent systems. Research applications include cloud/edge computing, electric vehicles, communication networks, non-cooperative games over time-varying directed communication networks, etc.

I received my M. Sc. degree from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in Applied Mathematics in December 2019. My research thesis focused on the development, analysis, and implementation of novel algorithms for a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate model. The plate solvers developed for this research project can be used together with an existing fluid solver to simulate more interesting fluid-structure interaction problems, such as blood flow in an artery.
